This file is designed to aid in deployment of this app:

This is a Flask app running a postgresql database. It can be deployed on AWS, Heroku or any other service that
allows for python back ends.

All required extensions are in the "requirements.txt" file. Using 'pip install -r requirements.txt' will
install everything this app needs to run. Heroku does this automatically.

The follow environmental variables must be set:
 CONFIG --> deployment
 SECRET_KEY --> any random assortment of characters (at least 20). This is used as the seed for random values
 DATABASE_URL --> the postgres connection URL


After the app is up and running the database can be initialize by running: 'python initialize_database.py'
WARNING: running this will wipe all data on the app. Be sure to back up anything you need.
The app will also ask you to create a single master account. This account can be used to create other accounts.
The password cannot be retrieved so be certain that it is not lost.

After this you can run 'python data_import.py' to import already existing self assessment data.
In the 'import' folder you will find examples of the csv files formats for importing. The files in 'import'
are demonstrative and can be removed or modified.

Be certain that all data is correct before importing as it cannot be removed.

A manual has been included for aid in using the front end of this app.
